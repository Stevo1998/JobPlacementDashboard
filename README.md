# Live Project

##Introduction
For the last two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked among other students in a team where, using the django framework, we developed 
a project that acts as an interactive website for managing one's collections of things related to various topics. Each member was asked to choose 
a topic that a person might want to keep track of and create a web app to manage data entered by the user as well as create a page where content is
displayed to  the user from an outside source by web scraping from an API. This project taught me a lot about the software development industry
as an individual programer and as part of a developement team as it was managed using the Agile/Scrum methodology during its developement. The Project
consisted of a two week sprint, during this time, each student was required to attend: a sprint planning session at the start of the sprint, daily stand-up
meetings ath the beggginning of each day, and a sprint review at the end of the sprint. The project was also broken down into ten stories, each being an individual 
feature of the main task being asked for. Over the two week sprint I learned a lot about undividual strengths and weaknesses, I also had the opportunity to work under a
project team environment which represented a real job team environment.

Below are descriptions of what some of the stories consisted on, along with code snippets, pictures and navigation links.

### CRUD Functionality
This task consisted on figuring out various elements of the object being tracked and create a model, a model form, and develop CRUD functionality to manage 
the data being entered by the user.

### API
Students were also tasked to create a page within their app where information from an API was presented to the user using JSON responses and url/http 
queries that relates to the chosen topic in some way.

 ### Front End Development
 The last task of the project was to work on front end improvements. This required some planning and drawing to figure out for I wanted to make my overall web app to look
 and behave, as well as what kind of modifications I needed to make on each page template to match what the page displays (i.e a form or a table).
